# LabView-2108-CDC

With the latest firmware, DI-1100/1110/1120/2108/4108/4208/4718 USB modules can be switched to CDC mode to allow LabView to program them in ASCII protocol level. This example demonstrates the basic protocol programming.

To switch to and program in CDC mode, please refer to https://www.dataq.com/resources/pdfs/misc/Dataq-Instruments-Protocol.pdf
