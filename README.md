# LabView-2108-CDC

With the latest firmware, DI-1100/1110/1120/2108/4108/4208/4718 **_USB_** modules can be switched to CDC mode to allow LabView to program them in ASCII protocol level. When using this approach, both **32-bit** and **64-bit** LabView can be employed. This example demonstrates the basic protocol programming.

To switch to and program in CDC mode, also how to identify the virtual COM port the device is connected, please refer to https://www.dataq.com/resources/pdfs/misc/Dataq-Instruments-Protocol.pdf
